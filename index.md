### CPSC 120

* Lab 6, part 2

    This lab in specific was a joy to create and learn from since it is a familiar game. It was here that in retrospect I learned the value of switch/case statements since before I knew how to effectively write it, I had to set the value to every unique valued card in the game. Looking past that, it was my first experience utilizing if and bool statements/functions in an effective manner that built a foundation for me to build upon. My favorite part was getting to experiment with if statements.

* Lab 10, part 2

    This lab had me stumped initially as I wrapped my head around how to navigate a 2d vector. However, once I was past that I was able to effectively call elements from the vector and run the return value from the function through error checking to catch any mistakes from user input. This was a simple program that had a lot of depth to learn from which is what I liked most about it.

* Lab 12, part 1

    Visuals! It was here that for the first time I could transform words from a file into colored pixels on my screen of my choice. I learned how to utilize a new rgb library and itâ€™s functions to create a controlled chaos of colors. What I liked most was getting to see a visual result of my program in the end. In addition to that, I used trigonometric functions for the first time to help create gradients to smoothly transition colors.
